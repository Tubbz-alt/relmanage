# there is an issue with this: conda build does "git-clone --recursive"
# but that fails, because the .gitmodules file doesn't use the "https:"
# form for the submodules, it uses the "git@" form, and the psrel
# account doesn't have permissions (or even a github account).  and
# even the "https:" version seems to prompt for a password when run
# as psrel.  for now I'm working around this by doing conda-build as
# a user with read permission, not psrel. -cpo
